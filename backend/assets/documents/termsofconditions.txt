Terms of Service
Effective Date: May 31, 2025

Welcome to TwitchTok (“we,” “us,” or “our”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the TwitchTok web application hosted at https://twitchtok.web.app and any associated APIs or services (collectively, the “Service”). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

1. Eligibility
Age Requirement. You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. If you are under 18, you need parental or guardian consent.

Account Registration. To access any functionality that requires a Twitch or TikTok account, you must register by providing a valid email address and creating a password, then link your Twitch and/or TikTok account via OAuth. You are responsible for keeping your credentials secure.

2. Description of the Service
Core Functionality. TwitchTok allows users to import clips or full‐length VODs from Twitch, automatically detect highlights (e.g., via audio spikes), add subtitles, convert to a vertical 9:16 format, generate a thumbnail/header, and export a video ready for TikTok or other vertical‐video platforms.

Third-Party Integrations.

Twitch API: Used solely to fetch the clips or VOD segments from your linked Twitch account.

TikTok API (optional): If you choose to link your TikTok account, the Service can prepare your final video for one-click upload.

Whisper/WhisperX (or equivalent speech-to-text): For generating subtitles.

FFmpeg & Video Hooks: For reformatting to vertical, overlaying header/text, and rendering the final video.

User Content. You remain the sole owner of any videos, text, tags, or other materials you upload or generate through TwitchTok (“User Content”). By using the Service, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, and process that content strictly to provide the Service. We do not claim any ownership over your original media.

3. Account Obligations & User Conduct
Accurate Information. You agree to provide truthful, up-to-date information when registering.

4. Fees & Payment
Free Tier & Paid Plans. The Service currently offers a free tier (basic highlight selection, 720p export) and may offer paid subscription tiers in the future (e.g., batch processing, higher export resolution). If paid tiers become available, advance payment will be required and are non-refundable except as required by law.

Pricing Changes. Any pricing adjustments for future paid plans will be communicated on our website prior to taking effect and will apply only to new or renewing subscriptions.
